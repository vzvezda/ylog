# ylog
Small library I am using for logging for personal projects.

* Log formatting is based on ["fmt"](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)

* Library provides the API the app code can use. 

* There maybe another library that implement the "Sink" interface, e.g. where the log records actually delivered (e.g. console, file, udp, etc)
